# csc207assignment2

In Assignment1, you and your partner used CRC cards to design a set of classes for maintaining a mock :ile system and interacting with it in a program that operates like a Unix shell. You also did some minimal programming in order to get used to sharing code using an SVN repository.In Assignment2, you will be working in a team of 4. The design requirements for Assignment2A are quite similar to those of Assignment1, although we have modified the commands a bit. There will be two parts to Assignment2. This is Assignment2A or the first part of Assignment2. 

Commands:

exit
 mkdir DIR ...

cd DIR

ls [PATH ...]? If p specifies a file, print p? If p specifies a directory, print p, a colon, then the contents of that directory, then an extra new line.Quit the program? If p does not exist, print a suitable message. 

pwd 
pushd DIR  
popd
history [number]cat FILE1 [FILE2 ...]

echo STRING [> OUTFILE]
echo STRING >> OUTFILE

man CMD

=================================================================Task1:Argue with your team until you have worked out a new design. Update your CRC cards and commit them or explain why no changes were necessary. Use the same format as last time (i.e. in Assignment1).Task2:Write the shell program implementing each of the above mentioned commands follow the SCRUM software development process. Make sure that, by the deadline of Assignment2A, the code you commit has been tested and fully documented. Remember that you should try to check in code that can be compiled and executed into your SVN repository.In order to do well for this Assignment, you MUST strictly adhere to the SCRUM software development process. Follow the instructions carefully that are mentioned in the grading scheme and what I talked about in lecture regarding Assignment2.
