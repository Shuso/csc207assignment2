What did I do last time?
- write code for Command, Directory, DirectoryManager,PWD,Shell
- Implemented PWD and History

What do I plan to do now? 
- work on new tasks for Sprint 2
	- start code for FileManager and FileSystem classes
	- Integrate the code together/
    - finish up CRC cards
    - write code for file and Directory.

Am I blocked on anything?
- Although I did my best to implement PWD and History, but we really
need to complete Directory before implement any code from command. I think
keeping track of the full path of every directory/file could be a 
challenge.
