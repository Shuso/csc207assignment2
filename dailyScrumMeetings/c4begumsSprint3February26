What did I do last time?
- Committed base code for Cat class.
- working locally on:
	- implementing Cat class (searching for files, reading files,
	 printing file content)
	- base code for Echo class. 

What do I plan to do now?
- committing finalized Cat class
- implementing Echo class (appending string into files, creating new files)
- making sure the classes are testable for the client meeting. 
	
Am I blocked on anything?
- how to create files using the Echo class (and the users input)
