a) What did I work on last time?
- Implement Mkdir class
- Implement File class
- Implement Directory class
- Implement Popd class
- Implement Pushd class

b) What do I plan to do now?
- Implement ls command  and echo command because they seems most challenging
to me. 
- complete Jshell

c) Am I currently blocked on anything?
- It is very frustrating to  debug code withough implementing Jshell and also
getters and setters are annoying. If it is possible, i want to make all the
 modifiers "protected". 
- I  think there will be a lot work to do when it comes to checking validity of 
input.
