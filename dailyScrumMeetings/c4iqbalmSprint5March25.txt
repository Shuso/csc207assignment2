What did I do last time?
- implemented toString method for NumberCommand
- created some test cases for NumberCommand in NumberCommandTest

What do I plan to do now?
- finalize the Number class
- add more test cases to Number class

Am I blocked on anything?
- figuring out what method(s) from CommandManager to use for CommandManager
instance in NumberCommand class
