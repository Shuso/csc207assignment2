What did I do last time?
- Began work on Ls and FileManager classes

What do I plan to do now?
- create a File class to represent actual files and a CRC card to
complement it
- fix any errors
- implement FileManager

Am I blocked on anything?
- figuring out how to collaborate Directory and Ls classes in order for Ls
to work
